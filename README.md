# Rescue Shakti

## Inspiration
On numerous occasions, we've found women concerned about their **safety**. We wanted to create something that just aides ladies in whatever manner imaginable. It began as a way to assist women, but it has since evolved into a web-app that anybody can use to avoid engaging with individuals who make them uncomfortable orÂ anxious.

## What it does
We have tried to implement the following features:
- **Send Location:** If you're out on a date with someone you don't know or in an unfamiliar place, you may _share your precise current position_ with your friends and family using the Rescue Shakti Web-app.
- **Fake Call Me:** If you're trapped in an embarrassing circumstance and can't get out, you may use Rescue Shakti to create a FAKE phone call and make a _quick get-away_.
- **Chatbot:** You may provide the number of the chatbot that _gives sarcastic responses_ to anyone you don't want to reveal your own phone number to and feel at ease.
