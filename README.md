# Rescue Shakti

## Inspiration
Sexual harassment and other forms of sexual violence in public spaces, both in urban and rural settings, are an everyday occurrence for women and girls in every country around the world. <br/>
On numerous occasions, we've found women concerned about their **safety**. We wanted to create something that just aides ladies in whatever manner imaginable. It began as a way to assist women, but it has since evolved into a web-app that anybody can use to avoid engaging with individuals who make them uncomfortable or anxious.

## What it does
We have tried to implement the following features:
- **Send Location:** If you're out on a date with someone you don't know or in an unfamiliar place, you may _share your precise current position_ with your friends and family using the Rescue Shakti Web-app.
- **Fake Call Me:** If you're trapped in an embarrassing circumstance and can't get out, you may use Rescue Shakti to create a FAKE phone call and make a _quick get-away_.
- **Chatbot:** You may provide the number of the chatbot that _gives sarcastic responses_ to anyone you don't want to reveal your phone number to and feel at ease.

## How we built it
We have used JavaScript to retrieve the Geolocation of the user and Google Maps API in order to share current location accurately with anyone anywhere across your contacts.
We have used Twilio to generate fake calls given to your registered mobile number with the least amount of latency.
The chatbot is hosted on _________

## Challenges we ran into
We are relatively new in working with Twilio as well as Google Maps APIs, however, we did manage to implement both the tech stacks into our project with a good expected amount of accuracy from an end-user product.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Being able to introduce a solution that has not been done before or perhaps, not widely known due to its limited feasibility of it. However, we have demonstrated the possibility, of how a web-app can be as minimal as possible, yet work incredibly well.

## What we learned
As mentioned earlier, all of us are relatively new to some technologies like Twilio, Google Map APIs, Bootstrap and so on. This hackathon has made us push our limits further to accomplish the goals we set for ourselves.
