# Rescue Shakti

## Inspiration
On numerous occasions, I've found women close to me being concerned about their safety. I wanted to create something that just aides ladies in whatever manner imaginable. It began as a way to assist women, but it has since evolved into a web-app that anybody can use to avoid engaging with individuals who make them uncomfortable orÂ anxious.

## What it does
We have tried to implement the following features:
- If you're out on a date with someone you don't know or in an unfamiliar place, you may share your precise current position with your friends and family using the Rescue Shakti Web-app.
- If you're trapped in an embarrassing circumstance and can't get out, you may use **Rescue Shakti** to create a FAKE phone call and make a quick get-away.
- You may provide the number of the chatbot that gives sarcastic responses to anyone you don't want to reveal your own phone number to and feel at ease.
